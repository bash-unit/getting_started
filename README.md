This getting started project gives you a few example of tests you may write
with [bash_unit](https://github.com/bash-unit/bash_unit/).

You can play with these tests by, first, [installing bash_unit](https://github.com/bash-unit/bash_unit/blob/main/README.adoc#how-to-install-bash_unit) and then git clone this project and run the tests:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bash-unit/getting_started.git
cd getting_started
bash_unit tests/test_*
```
